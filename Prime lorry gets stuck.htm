           <p>A huge articulated lorry once again proved how you can never fully rely 
on sat navs when travelling along the narrow roads of Cornwall after 
ending up in a tight squeeze in a seaside village. The unfortunate 
Amazon lorry driver found himself in a tight spot when he travelled to <a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.cornwalllive.com/all-about/st-agnes" rel="Follow" target="_self">St Agnes </a>on the North Coast and almost got wedged between two Grade-II listed buildings.</p> <p>The
 33-tonne lorry in the instantly recognisable Amazon livery had 
travelled down the main road into the village before reaching the tricky
 point between the Churchtown Arts store and the Grove Cottage and 
Stippy Stappy on Town Hill.</p> <p>Residents in St Agnes said the 
incident happened shortly before 5pm on Friday, August 18. One local 
said he spoke to the driver who told him he'd followed and trusted the 
sat nav.</p> He
 said: "He wouldn't reverse and kept driving forward. After about 25 
minutes and multiple dents on the vehicle he managed to free the lorry. I
 hope he hasn't damaged the grade-II listed buildings in the village."</p> <p>The
 bemused resident said this kind of sat nav fail has happened in St 
Agnes in the past but never to that extent. He joked: "The lovely driver
 blamed Satnav. Don't Amazon sell proper Satnavs for HGVs?"</p>  </div>
